# Calculations for BIONICMARKII Water-Usage Page

A normal bucket (20 Liters) will have 0.4 to 0.5 liters of overflown water per day.


1 year equals 365 days.


Let’s calculate for 325 days now:


(others days may be spent out-of-town or without a bath)


0.4 × 325 = 130 liters 

## 130 Litres per year, per person!!!

## 390 Litres per average household, per year!!!


Population of India =  1.3 Billion .

(EACH HOUSEHOLD HAS 3 BUCKETS ATLEAST)

## Means, 507 BILLION LITRES for India itself anually!!!
#### Isn't that in itself a major-major thingy!?
